# Resume Alignment Guide

To ensure your Portfolio and Resume tell the same story:

## 1. Job Titles
-   **Portfolio**: "Aspiring Full Stack Developer"
-   **Resume**: Use "Full Stack Developer (Fresher)" or "BCA Student".
-   *Avoid*: "Senior Engineer", "Architect", "Manager".

## 2. Skills
-   Ensure **Next.js**, **React**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB** are listed on your resume.
-   Add **"Generative AI Integration"** or **"Prompt Engineering"** under "Skills" or "Interests" in your resume to highlight the chatbot work.

## 3. Projects Section (Resume)
Add these 2 key projects to your resume:

### **Project 1: Personal Portfolio with AI Assistant**
-   *Tech*: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, OpenRouter API.
-   *Description*: "Built a responsive portfolio website featuring an integrated AI chatbot. The bot functions as a virtual assistant, answering recruiter queries using a custom system prompt and LLM integration."

### **Project 2: Student Management System**
-   *Tech*: Node.js, Express, MongoDB.
-   *Description*: "Developed a CRUD application for managing student records. Implemented secure REST APIs and role-based authentication."

## 4. Experience
-   If you have no internships yet, skip the "Experience" section and focus on **"Projects"** and **"Education"**.
-   If you did specific freelance work, list it as **"Freelance Web Developer"** and mention the technologies used.
