# AI vs Machine Learning: My Understanding

As a BCA student, here is how I understand and use these terms in my projects.

## Simplest Explanation
-   **AI (Artificial Intelligence)** is the **Destination**. It is the broad concept of machines initializing smart human behavior.
    -   *Example*: My Chatbot acting like me.
-   **ML (Machine Learning)** is the **Road**. It is a subset of AI where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every rule.
    -   *Example*: A model predicting house prices based on historical data.

## How I Use Them
### In My Portfolio Chatbot
-   **Is it AI or ML?** It uses **Generative AI** (specifically an LLM like ChatGPT/GPT-4 via OpenRouter).
-   **My Role**: I didn't "train" the model (that would be complex ML). I used **Prompt Engineering** (giving it a persona and rules) to control its AI behavior.

### In My Future Projects
-   I am learning **Supervised Learning** (ML) with Python (Scikit-Learn).
-   *Goal*: To build a system that detects spam emails or predicts student marks based on study hours.

## Key Differences (Viva Cheat Sheet)

| Future | AI | ML |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Goal** | Simulate intelligence | Learn patterns from data |
| **Type** | Broad umbrella | Specific subset |
| **My Project** | Chatbot (GenAI) | House Price Prediction (Regression) |
